##Contribute

As an attendee in the Contribute track, your submission will consist of a [devpost](https://hackillinois2016s.devpost.com/) submission and a link to your work-in-progress branch. If you have pull request(s) into the main repository, link those as well. 

If you have an open pull request, please include the following in the PR notes (or whatever is required by the project). If you don't have a PR ready for your submission, don't worry! You don't have to finish to submit. Create a file ```WIP.md``` in your branch that covers the same content.  
  * Issue(s) that you chose to work on.
  * Explanation of your decision making on approaching the issue
  * Discussion of your contribution's current status in the pipeline and what is remaining (if there is anything).
  * Credit contributors (teammates, and what each person worked on).

#### Examples:
* https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1312


Be prepared to answer: 
  * How the specific contribution process for your project played a role in the development of the contribution. If you had to make edits in your contribution before it was merged in, explain what was changed.
