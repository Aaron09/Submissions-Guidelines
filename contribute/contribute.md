##Contribute

If you have a pull request please include the following in the PR notes (or whatever is required by the project). If you dont have a PR ready, then create a file ```WIP.md``` in your branch that covers the same content.  
  * issue that you chose to tackle.
  * Explain your decision making on how to approach the issue
  * Discuss your contributions current status in the pipeline and what is remaining (if there is anything)
  * Credit contributors

Be prepared to answer: 
  * How the specific contribution process for your project played a role in the development of the contribution. If you had to make edits in your contribution before it was merged in, explain what was changed.
